# E06b-Sound-and-Music

This exersize tought me how to create and import simple sound effects onto Godot by using the software Audacity. I also learned how to record a piece of music by adding in 8 notes and exporting them into an Ogg Vorbis Audio File, I then added this music to my Assets File and dragged it into the stream section in the Inspector Panel.
